# Ai-tools

just a nice little class thing i made to save me time when using ollama and ElevenLabs (since i use them all the time)

Example on how to use

```py
from Aitools import Ai

chatbot = Ai("llama3.2") #this is just an example but you can use any model
response = chatbot.chat("Why is the sky blue")
print(response)
```

This is just a small little thing that i made and im still new to programming so i will take any advice or feedback for how i can make this better (i will not be updating this regularly though)
